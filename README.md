# Cancer Classification Models' Performance Analysis

This project focuses on analyzing cancer data and performing classification tasks to predict the diagnosis of breast cancer cases. The dataset used for analysis is the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Dataset, which contains features computed from breast mass images. The goal is to build machine learning models to classify breast cancer cases as either malignant or benign based on these features.

## Dataset

The Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Dataset is available from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It contains 569 instances with 30 numeric features, which include information about the characteristics of the cell nuclei present in the images. The target variable represents the diagnosis, with "M" indicating malignant and "B" indicating benign.

## Installation

To run the code in this project, you need Python 3 and the following dependencies:

- pandas
- scikit-learn
- seaborn
- matplotlib
- numpy

You can install the required dependencies using pip:

```shell
pip install pandas scikit-learn seaborn matplotlib numpy
```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/your-username/cancer-analysis.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```shell
cd cancer-analysis
```

3. Run the analysis script:

```shell
python analysis.py
```

4. The script will load the dataset, perform data preprocessing, build and evaluate machine learning models for cancer classification, and generate visualizations.

## Results

The analysis script will output various evaluation metrics and visualizations, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score for the classification models. Additionally, visualizations such as scatter plots, pair plots, and other relevant plots will be generated to visualize the relationships between the features and the diagnosis.
