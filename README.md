# MSDS-MachineLearning-Project1
# Cancer Expanded Analysis

This project focuses on analyzing cancer data and performing classification tasks to predict the diagnosis of breast cancer cases. The dataset used for analysis is the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Dataset, which contains features computed from breast mass images. The goal is to build machine learning models to classify breast cancer cases as either malignant or benign based on these features.

## Dataset

The Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Dataset is available from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It contains 569 instances with 30 numeric features, which include information about the characteristics of the cell nuclei present in the images. The target variable represents the diagnosis, with "M" indicating malignant and "B" indicating benign.
